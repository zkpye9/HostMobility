# Host Mobility

This project explores solutions of supporting host mobility. We propose a proxy-based solution
to handle this problem. The goal is to establish a session between the client and the
server, so that after changing the serverâ€™s IP address, the same connection session
still works. This solution works with all applications and transport protocols, and
does not require to change applications. Key concepts in our design include the use
of UDP tunnels and a sequence of private IP addresses to uniquely identify a host.
We also implement a simple and incrementally deployable change to DNS as a
mechanism to learn the address.
